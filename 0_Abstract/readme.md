In this project we are going to use one of the features of ATmega32A to adjust the brightness of 1 Watt LED.
The method that is used to adjust the speed of  LED is PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
This AVR Microcontroller PWM tutorial explains the PWM concept and generation of PWM in detail (You can also check this simple PWM generator circuit).
Consider a simple circuit as shown in figure.
